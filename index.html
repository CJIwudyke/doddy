It was never my intention to cause you pain or to fall short of the respect and love you deserve as my father. You have always been a source of strength, guidance, and wisdom for me, and I regret any moment where I might have taken that for granted. I know I can’t undo the past, but I want you to know how much I appreciate everything you’ve done for me. Your sacrifices, patience, and love mean the world to me, and I am sorry if I ever failed to show my gratitude. Please know that I am committed to doing better, to learning from my mistakes, and to honoring the bond we share. I love you, Dad, and I am so grateful to have you in my life. Thank you for being the incredible father that you are. I hope you can forgive me and allow us to move forward together. With love and sincerity, Chidi";
